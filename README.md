## Dynamic Questionnaire based on individual's performance
There are many tests where all the quetions might not be in par with the IQ of the test takers, hence questionnaires based on the individual's IQ are being used for the for many tests, i.e., the questions in the test are different for different test takers and gradually change based on the answers they have given to the previous questions.
A linear regression model is used in the python file above to train the model on the test taker's previous answers and predict the level of difficulty he/ she is ready to take for the next question.This develops a sense of confidence in test takers and also improves the metric systems of the test givers when wide range of populations is taking the particular test.
The data file above contains the questions with options, correct answers and the level of difficulty they pose. A basic linear regression model is used to predict the difficulty of the next question. This is a basic 20 question test, while the number of questions and the questions data can be changes by changing the parameters in the python file.
